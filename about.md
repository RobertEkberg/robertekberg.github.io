I'm a web analyst living in sweden. 

This blog is for creating content about analytics and implementation on the web. I will also use it for documentation of what i've learned.

If you have a question, just send me an e-mail.

You can [report](https://github.com/RobertEkberg/robertekberg.github.io/issues/new/) if there is something broken.
