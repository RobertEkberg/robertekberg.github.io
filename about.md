HEJ,
I'm Robert.

I have worked as a web analyst before. Where i collected, analyzed and took actions on insights i found in the data. My focus was mainly on implementation of tracking code on websites. Now, im currently studying mainframe and COBOL.

I love to explore and learn new things thats why i have certificates and education in many areas, like Analytics, UX and Mainframe.

This blog will be used for creating content about analytics, ux and mainframe. I will use if for documentation of what i learn.

If you have a question, just send me an e-mail.

You can [report](https://github.com/RobertEkberg/robertekberg.github.io/issues/new/) if there is something broken.
