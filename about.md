HEJ,
I'm Robert,
I'm Dyslexic.

I'm advocating for accessibility
because the ability to access benefits everyone.

I'm also a web analyst living in sweden, i have been working with analytics for about 4 years. I love combine my creative and analytical skills. That's why i also later chose to study UX.

I will use this blog to create content about analytics and implementation on the web. I will also use it for documentation of what i learn.

If you have a question, just send me an e-mail.

You can [report](https://github.com/RobertEkberg/robertekberg.github.io/issues/new/) if there is something broken.

**You can reach me here**
