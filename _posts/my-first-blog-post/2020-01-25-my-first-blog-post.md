description: Here you can read more about me both professionally and personally.

I decided to start this blog because i want to document what i learn, and hopefully it can also help other people. I'm creating content about analytics and implementation on web/app.

I have been interested in computers for more than 2 decades, i have been tinkering with analytics and implementation for 4 years, and worked in the field for 1 year.

Except from working with implementation, analysing and visualising data, i also have an interest for gaming and music production.

If you have a question, just send me an e-mail.
